## Overview

This Python project aims to provide a simple yet powerful tool for analyzing WhatsApp chat data. By utilizing machine learning techniques, it not only provides insights into chat patterns but also aims to predict behaviors and moods based on the conversation history.

## Features

- **Chat Analysis**: Utilizes data visualization techniques to analyze various aspects of WhatsApp chats, including message frequency, word usage, and more.
- **Mood Prediction**: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict the mood or behavior of participants based on their chat history.
- **Customizable Visualization**: Offers a range of customizable visualization options using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles data preprocessing tasks such as extracting URLs, emojis, and cleaning text using regular expressions.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to be easily integrated into existing projects or used as a standalone tool.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `seaborn`
  - `urlextract`
  - `emoji`
  - `wordcloud`

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install matplotlib pandas seaborn urlextract emoji wordcloud
   ```

2. **Data Preparation**: Export your WhatsApp chat history as a text file. Make sure the file is in a readable format.

3. **Run the Analyzer**: Use the provided Python script to analyze your WhatsApp chat data:
   ```
   python whatsapp_chat_analyzer.py path/to/your/chat_history.txt
   ```

4. **Explore Results**: After running the script, explore the generated visualizations and insights provided. Customize the visualizations as needed for your analysis.
