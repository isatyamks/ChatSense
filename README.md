# WhatsApp Chat Analyzer and Behaviour Predictor


## Overview

This machine learning model aims to provide a simple but powerful tool for analyzing WhatsApp chat data. By utilizing  some machine learning techniques, it not only provides insights into chat but in future i will make it to predict behaviors and moods based on the conversation history.

## Features

- **Chat Analysis**: Utilizes data visualization techniques to analyze various aspects of WhatsApp chats, including message frequency, word usage, and more.
- **Mood Prediction**: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict the mood or behavior of participants based on their chat history.
- **Customizable Visualization**: Offers a range of customizable visualization options using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles data preprocessing tasks such as extracting URLs, emojis, and cleaning text using regular expressions.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to be easily integrated into existing projects or used as a standalone tool.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `seaborn`
  - `urlextract`
  - `emoji`
  - `wordcloud`

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install matplotlib pandas seaborn urlextract emoji wordcloud
   ```

2. **Data Preparation**: Export your WhatsApp chat history as a text file. Make sure the file is in a readable format.

3. **Run the Analyzer**: Use the provided Python script to analyze your WhatsApp chat data:
   ```
   run the app.py
   ```

4. **Explore Results**: After running the script, explore the generated visualizations and insights provided. Customize the visualizations as needed for your analysis.
